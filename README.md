consistent_df is a Python package designed to provide shared DataFrame operations that can be
used across multiple modules, promoting code reuse and consistency across multiple modules.
By maintaining type consistency and utilizing a drop indexes approach similar to pandas,
his package simplifies DataFrame manipulations and ensures robust testing. By centralizing
shared DataFrame operations in the we ensure consistency and efficiency in our development
processes, helping to maintain high-quality code across various projects.
